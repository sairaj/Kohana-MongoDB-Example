# Kohana Mongo DB Example

This is a sample project created to learn working of [Mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) with [Kohana](http://kohanaframework.org) php framework.
I might not have used best practices in kohana framework now but will improve it over the time.

Currently utilized modules:-

Kohana::Controller

Kohana::Config

Kohana::Session

#Future Scope
Improve authorization with Kohana::Auth module and add ORM for effective DB communication.
